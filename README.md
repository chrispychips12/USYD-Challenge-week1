Horiseon Services Code Refactor for Accessibility

Simple overview of use/purpose.

This project was undertaken to refactor code and to meet accessiblity requirements.

Description

Some of the refactored code include:

- CSS Selectors and properties consolidated (following semantic procedure)
- HTML Code formated
- Alt attributes added to images
- HTML was also refactored to include the right sections, unnecessary use of classes and ID were removed and replaced with the correct section element, eg , , and
- class/ID renaming to follow best practices
- Contributors names and contact info
- Application deployed
- All links working

In the refactoring, the criterias below were recognised and added by myself to meet accessibilty standards as well as the following of semantic HTML elements:
- Semantic Elements found in the cource code
- HTML element structure found and the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning in the source code 
- Image elements found and added accessible alt attributes in the source code 
- Heading element found and structure falls in sequential order in the source code
- The title element is found with a concise and descriptive title in the source code

By refactoring the code with the above standards met, I was able to make the page much more accessible and make the code much easier to read. 
It was also consolidated in a way that removed all redundant CSS elements with proper parent-child structuring

The refactoring also negated any primary structural changes so as the layout, content and images remained the same after deployment.
